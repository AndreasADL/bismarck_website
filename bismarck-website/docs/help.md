# Need Help? We've Got You Covered!

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance during your stay. Here are some options to get help:

- Ask your floor neighbors for help. Most people are kind and ready to assist. Getting to know your neighbors is key to a pleasant experience. Check if your floor has a WhatsApp group to connect with others.

- Contact the Dorm Mentors for help with just about anything. You can find their responsibilities and contact details posted by the front door.

- For various matters, you can ask Herr J. Jackisch, our House master. For quicker responses, consider writing in German (you can use Deepl.com for translation), keep emails concise, clear, and limit requests to one per email. This helps ensure a swift response.

- For general inquiries and support, you can also reach out to Studierendenwerk, who provide services for students in need.

Remember, we're here to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Don't hesitate to ask for help!
